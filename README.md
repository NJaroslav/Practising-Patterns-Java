# Practising-Patterns-Java
This is a simple GUI project that uses patterns such as MVC, Strategy, Visitor, Iterator

Important: this project shows the use of patterns in a specific task, for familiarization, nothing more.

-##Description:

-The model is a BitSet class, which is a sequence of zeros and ones.
It represents an abstract sequence of natural numbers which is determined by the following rules:
If the i-th element of BitSet is equal to 1, then the element with value i is present, otherwise it is not.

-Strategy and Visitor patterns are used to calculate the cardinality of the original sequence in different ways.

-The MVC pattern is used to change and display the data on(from) the frame.
